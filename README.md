## 🧪 Programming Task 2 – Python Solutions

Welcome to my Python solutions repository for Programming Task 2!
- This project contains simple programs written in Python Jupyter notebooks to solve basic algorithm questions.
-  These problems help improve logic and coding skills using Python.

#### 📂 `What’s Inside`

This repository includes the following notebook files:
- Defanging an IP Address.ipynb – Solution to convert IP addresses into a defanged format.
- Find Numbers with an Even Number of Digits.ipynb – Count numbers that have an even number of digits.
- How Many Numbers Are Smaller Than the Current Number.ipynb – For each number, find how many numbers are smaller than it.
- Number of Good Pairs.ipynb – Find pairs of equal numbers at two positions.
- Subtract the Product and Sum of Digits of an Integer.ipynb – Compute difference between product and sum of digits.
- XOR Operation in an Array.ipynb – Perform XOR operation on an array of numbers.

#### 🚀 `What You Can Learn`

By exploring these notebooks you will:
- Practice Python basics like loops, lists and conditionals.
- See how to break problems into steps and solve them with code.
- Get comfortable with Jupyter Notebooks as a coding environment.

#### 🛠️ `Tools Used`

1. Python – The main programming language used.

2. Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) – A notebook for writing code and explanations together.

#### 📌 `How to Use`

1. Open the repository on GitHub.
2. Download or clone it to your computer.
3. Open the .ipynb files in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code.
4. Read and run the code cells to understand how solutions work.
